Active Ranking from Noisy Comparisons    
===

`main-*.py` contains the main entry point for experiments.
* `-aht`: compares `pit` and `hpit`.
* `-ahs`: compares `pit` and `hpits`.
* `-pbs`: compares `pit` and `probesort`.

Most algorithms here are online, the data is generated on the fly in `model.py`. 
* `Uniform`: every pair of items has the same probability of being preferred over the order.
* `HBTL`: the preference is generated by HBTL model.
* `WST`: probability is generated at random based on a ground truth ranking and satisfy
         Weak Stochastic Transitivity with coherent rank assumption Weak Stochastic Transitivity (WST) 
         with coherent rank assumption.


Implemented algorithms are: 
* `sort_merge`: classic merge sort.
* `sort_pit`: a reimplementation of [Rank-from-noisy-comparisons](https://github.com/WenboRen/ranking-from-noisy-comparisons).
* `sort_hpit`: implements some active ranking methods described in [paper][1].
* `sort_hpits`: implements some active ranking methods that works for a more general model in the above paper.
* `sort_probe`: an algorithm designed for better sample complexity than above methods 
when WST is the case.
